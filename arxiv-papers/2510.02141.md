The Hubbard model has occupied the minds of condensed matter physicists for most part of
the last century. This model provides insight into a range of phenomena in correlated electron
systems. We wish to examine the paradigm of quantum algorithms for solving such many-body
problems. The focus of our current work is on the one-dimensional model which is integrable,
meaning that there exist analytical results for determining its ground state. In particular, we
demonstrate how to perform a gate-based quantum computer simulation of quantum annealing for
the Hubbard Hamiltonian. We perform simulations for systems with up to 40 qubits to study the
scaling of required annealing time for obtaining the ground state. We find that for the half-filled
cases considered, there is a substantial quantum speed-up over algorithms based on the Bethe-ansatz
equations.

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**


The Hubbard model is believed to be one of the simplest models that can capture qualitative behaviour of
correlated fermions which cannot be reconciled within
band theory [1]. The Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional
lattice with open boundaries emerging from this model
is given by

Bethe-ansatz equations also for this version of the problem, which were first calculated by H. Schulz [6]. The

_{λ_ 1 _, λ_ 2 _. . . λ_ _N_ _↓_ _}_ that determine the ground state read

at site _i_ . The first sum of terms describes the nearestneighbor hopping of the electrons, _t_ _H_ being the hopping
integral. The second sum describes the on-site repulsive
interaction with strength _U >_ 0.
Despite the apparent simplicity of the Hamiltonian, exact results for the solution to the eigenvalue problem of
this Hamiltonian only exist in the thermodynamic limit
for the one-dimensional lattice [2]. Even for the onedimensional model, the procedure is non-trivial and was
first performed by Lieb and Wu [3] for periodic boundary
conditions. They used the Bethe-ansatz [4] to reduce the
eigenvalue problem to the Bethe-ansatz equations, which
are a set of coupled non-linear algebraic equations, now
called the Lieb-Wu equations. The Lieb-Wu equations
can be analysed in the thermodynamic limit, and certain
properties like the ground state energy can be obtained
in a closed form by solving a set of coupled integral equations. The one-dimensional Hubbard model is thus integrable [5] and is considered to be _solved_ in this sense.
In the present paper, we study the finite onedimensional Hubbard model with open boundaries from

Going to the thermodynamic limit by taking _L →∞_,
and keeping the ratios _N/L_ and _N_ _↓_ _/N_ constant, Eqs. (2)
and (3) turn into coupled integral equations [6]. These
equations can be solved analytically for the case of 2 _N_ _↓_ =
_N_ = _L_, and the corresponding ground state energy can
be calculated. However, for a general _L_, _N_ and _N_ _↓_, a
computer is needed to solve the respective Bethe-ansatz
equations. The time required to solve the equations by
a root finding algorithm scales polynomially with _L_ and
thus, the ground state energy can also be found for large
_L_ . On the other hand, finding the ground state using
the roots is still exponentially expensive due to the requirement of calculating an exponentially large number
of coefficients.

For the Grover algorithm [7], it was shown that a
quadratic speed-up can be achieved compared to the
best-known classical algorithm for searching for an item
in a list. This result played a significant role in demonstrating the potential of quantum computers. Similarly,
a question emerges in the context of integrable quantum many-body systems, which are polynomially hard
to solve: Whether a quantum algorithm can provide any
kind of benefit in finding the ground state of such systems. The one-dimensional Hubbard model serves as the
perfect toy problem in taking a step towards answering
this question.
Various techniques to address this question are currently being investigated. One of the popular algorithms
to obtain the ground state is VQE [8]. In references

[9, 10], strategies for implementing VQE on a quantum
computer are presented. Even though they show good
success probabilities for achieving the ground state of
Hubbard systems, the scalability of these methods is still
unclear.

An alternative way to approach the problem of finding
the eigenstates of Eq. (1) is to use a quantum algorithm
to prepare the Bethe-ansatz states directly on a quantum
computer [11, 12]. These papers demonstrate methods
to obtain eigenstates of _XX_ and _XXZ_ models using the
respective Bethe-ansatz equations. They were able to
achieve linear scaling of resources for finding particular
eigenstates of these models. However, success probabilities for large systems were not shown.
A distinct method that is gaining popularity is the
algorithm of quantum annealing [13–15], which can be
used to find the ground state of a Hamiltonian. Quantum annealing is being investigated prominently for solving optimization problems. Various problems have been
approached through such ideas [14–17], and there has
been some progress in understanding what kind of an
advantage they can bring, if any, over classical methods
of solving them [18–23].
On the other hand, one of the most compelling
promises of quantum computers is the simulation of
quantum systems [24, 25]. Due to the advent of analog
quantum devices, the dynamics of a variety of many-body
quantum systems can be implemented on them [26–28].
Digital quantum computers also offer prospects for modelling strongly correlated quantum systems [25, 29–31]
that are too large to be treated by conventional computers. Moreover, simulating quantum dynamics of these
systems on a quantum computer enables the investigation of several physical phenomena, such as phase transitions [28, 29].
In light of all this, we wish to examine the potential
of quantum annealing in order to understand its utility for finding the ground state of quantum systems by
simulating quantum dynamics of the Hubbard model on
a quantum computer. We implement the protocol of
quantum annealing on a quantum computer simulator,
demonstrating the resource requirement for a faithful
gate-based simulation of a quantum system while study

ing its performance for achieving the ground state of the
Hubbard model described by the Hamiltonian Eq. (1).
We investigate the scaling of the performance of the
quantum annealing algorithm to solve the problem under consideration with respect to the system size. We
find that the time required to find the ground state of
the Hubbard model on a one-dimensional lattice in a subspace with 2 _N_ _↓_ = _N_ = _L_, scales at most linearly with
system size. This suggests a substantial quantum speedup over other algorithms to calculate the ground state of
the Hubbard model.
We begin by providing the background about adiabatic
quantum computing and quantum annealing in section
II. In section III, we show how the algorithm of quantum
annealing for the Hubbard model can be implemented
on a gate-based quantum computer. Subsequently, we
present our results of the simulations we perform for systems with up to 40 qubits in section IV and demonstrate
the analysis. Finally, we discuss the conclusions and implications of these results in section V.


**II.** **QUANTUM ANNEALING**


**A.** **Theory**


Quantum annealing is a method that is based on the
exploitation of the quantum adiabatic theorem [32, 33]
to find eigenstates of Hamiltonians that are computationally hard to find. The theorem points us towards an
idea which is now quite well known that, if the system
is in an eigenstate and the Hamiltonian is changed adiabatically, then the system remains in the corresponding
eigenstate of the evolving Hamiltonian, provided that the
energy gap of the eigenstate with respect to other instantaneous eigenstates does not close during the evolution.
This property can be used to calculate the ground state
of a Hamiltonian without explicitly solving its eigenvalue
equation, which is generally hard if the Hilbert space is
large.
Suppose we have a Hamiltonian _H_ _p_ for which we want
to find the ground state given by,


_H_ _p_ _|ϕ_ _p,_ 0 _⟩_ = _E_ _p,_ 0 _|ϕ_ _p,_ 0 _⟩_ _,_


where _E_ _p,_ 0 is the lowest eigenvalue of _H_ _p_ and _|ϕ_ _p,_ 0 _⟩_ is the
corresponding eigenvector. In lieu of solving this eigenvalue problem, we can prepare a system in a quantum
state _|ψ⟩_ = _|ϕ_ _i,_ 0 _⟩_, where _|ϕ_ _i,_ 0 _⟩_ is a known and easy-toprepare ground state of some initial Hamiltonian _H_ _i_, and
transform the system such that the instantaneous Hamiltonian, say _H_ ( _s_ ), can be written as,


_H_ ( _s_ ) = _f_ _i_ ( _s_ ) _H_ _i_ + _f_ _p_ ( _s_ ) _H_ _p_ _,_


where _f_ _i_ ( _s_ ) and _f_ _p_ ( _s_ ) are real functions of _s_ so that _H_ ( _s_ )
goes from _H_ _i_ _→_ _H_ _p_ as _s_ goes from 0 _→_ 1. Provided that
the ground state energy of _H_ ( _s_ ) is always separated by
a gap from the energy of the first excited state during


this process and that _H_ ( _s_ ) evolves adiabatically into _H_ _p_,
the state of the system at _s_ = 1 would be _|ϕ_ _p,_ 0 _⟩_ . This
protocol of transforming the Hamiltonian using a single
parameter _s_ so that we obtain the ground state of _H_ _p_ is
nowadays called quantum annealing.
Evolution of real systems can never be described by

an adiabatically evolving quantum state, which begs the
question of how slowly the Hamiltonian should evolve in
order to obtain a reasonable estimate of the ground state.
If we call _|ϕ_ _j_ ( _s_ ) _⟩_ as the _jth_ eigenstate of _H_ ( _s_ ) and _|ψ_ ( _s_ ) _⟩_
as the instantaneous state of the system, the following
bound [34]

serves as a statement of the adiabatic theorem, giving
us a window to look at and analyse the behaviour of
total quantum annealing time required with respect to
system size. In Eq. (5), _T_ _A_ is the total annealing time,
∆( _s_ ) = _E_ 1 ( _s_ ) _−_ _E_ 0 ( _s_ ), and _||A||_ represents the spectral
norm of matrix _A_ .

Equation (5) shows that for a given problem, the transition probability (left side of Eq. (5)) will always be
bounded by _T_ _A_ _[−]_ [2] times a value that depends on the gaps
in the spectrum and the annealing schedule. Thus, this
gap-dependent factor could help us understand how _T_ _A_
scales across system sizes for a given annealing schedule.


**B.** **Annealing the Hubbard Hamiltonian**


We investigate the protocol of quantum annealing for
a particular schedule to find the ground state of Eq. (1)
with half-filled lattices. We want to study how the total
annealing time scales to get a reasonable estimate of the
ground state with system size. To this end, we simulate
quantum annealing for the Hubbard Hamiltonian for a
range of system sizes and evaluate the performance. The
annealing schedule that we use is,


_H_ ( _s_ ) = (1 _−_ _s_ ) _H_ _I_ + _sH_ _H_ _,_ (6)


where _H_ _I_ is the initial Hamiltonian.

The instantaneous Hamiltonian linearly depends on
the anneal parameter _s_, starting from the initial Hamiltonian and ending as the Hubbard Hamiltonian at the end
of the anneal. It is important to choose the initial Hamiltonian, such that its ground state is easy to prepare. A
natural choice is,



boundaries can be written as,

The annealing Hamiltonian evolves from the Hamiltonian for free fermions hopping on a lattice at _s_ = 0, and
the interaction grows in strength as _s_ goes to 1. This implies that for non-zero _s_, the instantaneous Hamiltonian
is a Hubbard Hamiltonian with _sU_ as the interaction
strength. Hence, this choice of the initial Hamiltonian
also helps us to understand how quantum annealing performs for various interaction strengths.


**III.** **GATE-BASED SIMULATIONS**


Simulating ideal quantum annealing means solving the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE)


_i_ ℏ _dt_ _[d]_ _[|][ψ]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[⟩]_ [=] _[ H]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[ |][ψ]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[⟩]_ _[,]_ (9)


for the Hamiltonian Eq. (8) with _t_ = _sT_ _A_ .
Since we are interested in investigating the performance of a quantum computer for finding the ground
state using quantum annealing, we simulate Schr¨odinger
dynamics using quantum circuits. To perform gate-based
simulations of quantum annealing for Hubbard-like models, we need two kinds of circuits:


1. Initial state preparation circuit


2. Circuit for performing dynamics of quantum annealing


In the following sections, we describe how we construct
these circuits to perform quantum annealing for fermion
systems on a digital quantum computer.

Clearly, Eq. (7) is just the hopping part of Eq. (1). Thus,
the instantaneous Hamiltonian for a Hubbard system in
one dimension with nearest neighbour hopping and open


**A.** **Jordan-Wigner transformation**


The first step is to transform the fermion Hamiltonian
into a qubit Hamiltonian comprising Pauli matrices. To
preserve the fermion character of the Hamiltonian, the
operators in the transformed Hamiltonian need to obey
the same anti-commutation relations as fermion operators. We also need to map the fermion states to qubit
states. A straightforward way to do this is to use the
Jordan-Wigner transformation [35] in which the 2 _L_ spinorbitals on _L_ lattice sites are mapped onto 2 _L_ qubits
where each occupied spin-orbital corresponds to _|_ 1 _⟩_ and
each unoccupied spin-orbital corresponds to _|_ 0 _⟩_ .
According to the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the

The Hamiltonian Eq. (8) commutes with the total
number operator _N_ . Our quantum annealing protocol
also preserves the total number of spin- _↑_ electrons ( _N_ _↑_ )
and the total number of spin- _↓_ electrons ( _N_ _↓_ ). This
means that to find the ground state with a specific _N_ _↑_
and _N_ _↓_, we need to start in a state with the same _N_ _↑_
and _N_ _↓_ .
In fermion language, the ground state of Eq. (7) in a
subspace with a given value of _N_ _↑_ and _N_ _↓_ reads


_|ψ_ (0) _⟩_ = _c_ _[†]_ _k_ 1 _↑_ _[c]_ _k_ _[†]_ 2 _↑_ _[. . . c]_ _k_ _[†]_ _N↑_ _↑_ _[. . . c]_ _k_ _[†]_ _N↓_ _↓_ _[|][V][ ⟩]_ _[,]_ (14)


where _|V ⟩_ is the fermion vacuum state (all zero’s) and
the _k_ ’s are chosen so that [�] _ϵ_ _k_ is the minimum. For a
simple example, see Fig. 1.
Substituting Eq. (12) into Eq. (14), we obtain the initial ground state _|ψ_ (0) _⟩_ in terms of the fermion operators
for which we defined the Jordan-Wigner transformation
by Eq. (10). This enables us to write the ground state
Eq. (14) in the computational basis and subsequently
prepare it using Givens rotations as discussed in Appendix A.

Being equipped with a circuit that prepares the initial state, we are now in a position to perform quantum
annealing starting from this state. The next subsection
outlines how we construct the quantum circuit for the
quantum annealing process itself.

Simulating the real-time dynamics of the fermion
Hamiltonian Eq. (8) is equivalent to simulating the realtime dynamics of the qubit Hamiltonian Eq. (11). We
use the latter to construct quantum circuits that perform quantum annealing and use them to study their
performance.


**B.** **Initial state preparation**


An essential step in performing quantum annealing is
to prepare the system in the ground state of the initial
Hamiltonian. Therefore, we need a quantum circuit that
initializes the state of a quantum computer in the ground
state of _H_ _I_ .
Preparing the ground state of _H_ _I_ on a quantum computer might not be an easy task. Fortunately, through
the work in references [29, 30], we have an algorithm to
prepare the ground state of this non-interacting fermion
Hamiltonian.
The first step is to diagonalize _H_ _I_ by Fourier (sine)
transformation. Using

**C.** **Time-evolution**


To simulate quantum annealing, we need to solve the
TDSE given by Eq. (9). The general solution is given by
a unitary operator that transforms the initial state to a
state _|ψ_ ( _t_ ) _⟩_ at time _t_,


_|ψ_ ( _t_ ) _⟩_ = _U_ ( _t, t_ 0 ) _|ψ_ ( _t_ 0 ) _⟩_ _._ (15)


If the Hamiltonian _H_ is time-independent, the operator _U_ is given by, _̸_


_U_ ( _t, t_ 0 ) = _e_ _[−][iH]_ [(] _[t][−][t]_ [0] [)] _,_ (16)


where we have set ℏ = 1. _̸_
The Hamiltonian Eq. (11) is time-dependent through
the time dependence of _s_ = _t/T_ _A_ where _T_ _A_ is the total
quantum annealing time. However, if we approximate
_H_ ( _s_ ) as piece-wise constant, the time evolution operator
can be well approximated by,

in this process is identifying and grouping mutually commuting terms within _H_ ( _s_ ). Doing so, not only mitigates
errors arising from non-commutativity but also enables
the design of more efficient quantum circuits. Below, we
introduce a natural grouping scheme that respects the
intrinsic symmetries of _H_ ( _s_ ). We introduce

This choice exactly preserves _N_ _↑_ and _N_ _↓_, as should be
the case with the exact time evolution. However, since
the time step _τ_ is chosen to be sufficiently small, _N_ _↑_
and _N_ _↓_ will be approximately preserved also with other
groupings. Therefore, we adopt the alternative grouping,

for a small time step _τ_ [36].
The task of simulating the Schr¨odinger dynamics has been reduced to calculating the exponential
_e_ _[−][iτH]_ [(] _[nτ]_ _[−][τ/]_ [2)], and a quantum circuit needs to be constructed for this exponential. Constructing a circuit _̸_
that performs this operation on the state of a quantum
computer exactly is not trivial. Moreover, we want circuits that can be realized with 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates
since potential quantum computing architectures might _̸_
be able to implement these. This means that we need a
way to decompose the full unitary evolution into unitary
gates that operate on at most 2 qubits.
We use the Suzuki-Trotter approximation [37, 38] in
which, by using a small enough _τ_, the exponential of a
Hamiltonian can be well approximated by a product of
exponentials of each term _H_ _j_ in the Hamiltonian. For
each small time step _τ_ [36, 39],

which provides a substantial reduction of the total number of gates over the choice above, facilitating more efficient circuits. Since for the Pauli matrices _σ_ _i_ _[α]_ [with di-]

gates is 2( _L −_ 1) + 2( _L −_ 1) + 2 _× L_ = 6 _L −_ 4. The total
number of gates required to perform quantum annealing
for a given _T_ _A_ is therefore ( _T_ _A_ _/τ_ )(18 _L −_ 4).
In summary, the product-formula algorithm allows us

_̸_ to perform gate-based quantum annealing simulations by

a circuit the size of which scales linearly with system size.
The amount of resources required to obtain a reasonable
estimate of the ground state of the 1-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian then depends on how the required total
annealing time _T_ _A_ ( _L_ ) scales with the problem size. The
total number of gates required to find the ground state is
then _O_ ( _L × T_ _A_ ( _L_ )). Discovering how _T_ _A_ ( _L_ ) grows with
system size allows us to gauge how the amount of quantum computer resources scale with the problem size.


**IV.** **RESULTS AND ANALYSIS**


The methods discussed in the previous section for performing simulations of gate-based quantum annealing for
the problem under consideration can be used to calculate
a metric to study the scaling behaviour of quantum annealing to find the ground state of the Hubbard model.
For the largest particle number subspaces, corresponding to 2 _N_ _↓_ = _N_ = _L_, we use the quantum annealing
algorithm to find the ground state of the Hamiltonian
Eq. (1). By doing this for increasing _L_, we infer a scaling
of required annealing time from the information of the
final quantum state.
We construct complete circuits as described in the preceding sections for the simulation of the annealing Hamiltonian Eq. (8). We do this for systems as large as 20 sites
or 40 qubits and for a range of total annealing times ( _T_ _A_ ).
We use the J¨ulich Universal Quantum Computer Simulator (JUQCS) [42, 43], which is a high-performance program to simulate universal quantum circuits. The simulations were performed on the JUWELS-Booster [44]

thus 4 _L_ + 4 _L_ + 2 _×_ 2 _L_ = 12 _L_ and the number of 2-qubit

machine at the J¨ulich Supercomputing Center.
One time step of the quantum annealing algorithm of
a 40-qubit system requires 356 gates. For the largest annealing time considered ( _T_ _A_ = 40) and a time step of
_τ_ = 0 _._ 025, the number of time steps is 1600 and the corresponding number of gates is 569600. Including initial
state preparation, the total number of gates in the circuit
is then 570918. This problem is simulated on 256 nodes
of the JUWELS-Booster using 1024 GPUs and a total
computing time of approximately 12 hours.
From the final state _|ψ_ ( _s_ = 1) _⟩_ obtained by the simulation, the program calculates the energy _⟨ψ_ (1) _| H_ _H_ _|ψ_ (1) _⟩_ .
We do this for a range of _T_ _A_, and we obtain the energy
of the final state as a function of total annealing time.
We consider the residual energy as a metric to quantify the proximity of the state obtained after quantum
annealing to the exact ground state. Figure 2 shows the
residue ∆ _E_ = _⟨ψ_ (1) _| H_ _H_ _|ψ_ (1) _⟩−_ _E_ 0 ( _L_ ) versus _T_ _A_ for a
few system sizes. The exact ground state energy _E_ 0 ( _L_ )
is obtained through the numerical solution of the Betheansatz equations, as outlined in Appendix B, where we
also present the scaling of the required computation time
with system size. Table I shows _E_ 0 ( _L_ ) for _L_ = 2 to
_L_ = 20, 2 _N_ _↓_ = _N_ = _L_, and _U/t_ _H_ = 4 _,_ 8 _,_ 16.
From Fig. 2, it follows that for a certain value of the
energy residue which depends on system size, say _ϵ_ ( _L_ ),
when ∆ _E ≤_ _ϵ_ ( _L_ ), the following holds consistently across
system sizes:


∆ _E ≈_ _[α]_ [(] _[L]_ [)] _._ (28)

_T_ _A_ [2]


From the right hand side of Eq. (5), we expect that
the transition probability should behave like _T_ _A_ _[−]_ [2] for
sufficiently long annealing times [45]. Clearly, the _T_ _A_ dependence of the energy residue shows a similar behaviour. The adiabatic theorem thus provides support

We examine the time required by the quantum annealing algorithm to determine the ground state energy with
a certain prescribed precision ∆ _E_ _[∗]_ (see Fig. 2). Then,
there is a system size _L_ _[∗]_ for which the point of onset corresponds to _ϵ_ ( _L_ _[∗]_ ) _≈_ ∆ _E_ _[∗]_ . For all _L < L_ _[∗]_, the required
annealing time to obtain this precision can be determined
from the _L_ -dependence of _α_ ( _L_ ).
We plot _α_ ( _L_ ) with respect to system size and show the
result in Fig. 4. For _U/t_ _H_ = 4, the plot fits very well to


_α_ ( _L_ ) _∝_ _L_ [1] _[.]_ [234] _._ (29)

∆ _E ∝_ _[L]_ [1] _[.]_ [234] _,_ (30)

groups of commuting terms, the quantum annealing process needs to be performed 3 _N_ _S_ times, where _N_ _S_ is the
number of samples that depends on the desired precision
of the measurement. Nevertheless, this does not affect
the _L_ -dependence of the required total time to calculate
the ground state energy, which is 3 _N_ _S_ _× T_ _A_ ( _L_ ).
Computing the ground state up to a residual energy
of ∆ _E_ _[∗]_ by quantum annealing, this residue will approximately correspond to _ϵ_ ( _L_ _[∗]_ ) for a certain large _L_ _[∗]_ . From
the above arguments, it follows that for system sizes
_L < L_ _[∗]_, quantum annealing yields the ground state of
the half-filled one-dimensional Hubbard model in sublinear time. For arbitrarily large _L > L_ _[∗]_, the required
annealing time is bounded by a linear function of system
size.

In contrast, although the Bethe-ansatz equations can
be solved and the ground state energy can be obtained in
polynomial time, determining the ground state requires
the calculation of an exponential number of coefficients
demanding exponential computational resources. This
implies that quantum annealing provides an exponential
quantum speed-up over other methods for finding the
ground state of the one-dimensional Hubbard model.


**V.** **DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK**


Integrable quantum systems usually have a set of coupled equations that solve the eigenvalue problem of the
system exactly. However, to solve these equations, one
has to resort to numerical means that require time, which
is polynomial in the number of equations. For the onedimensional Hubbard model with open boundaries, the
equations that need to be solved to find the ground state
are the Bethe-ansatz Eqs. (2) and (3). Once solved, the
roots can be used to calculate the ground state energy,
as well as the ground state coefficients that grow expo


~~_√_~~



(31)
∆ _E_ _[∗]_ _[,]_



where _L < L_ _[∗]_ .
The largest systems up to which Eq. (31) holds depends on the scaling of _ϵ_ ( _L_ ) with system size. If _ϵ_ ( _L_ )
remains constant or decreases polynomially, then the annealing time to obtain the ground state energy with specified precision ∆ _E_ _[∗]_ only grows polynomially. For a system size _L_ for which _ϵ_ ( _L_ ) _<_ ∆ _E_ _[∗]_, the time required to
obtain this precision to the ground state is less than the
time required for the onset of the _T_ _A_ _[−]_ [2] regime.
Thus, assuming that


_α_ ( _L_ ) _∝_ _L_ _[a]_ and _ϵ_ ( _L_ ) _∝_ _L_ _[−][b]_ _,_


then for _L > L_ _[∗]_, where ∆ _E_ _[∗]_ _> ϵ_ ( _L_ ), we have from
Eq. (28),



_T_ _A_ _< T_ _A_ _[′]_ _[≈]_

where _T_ _A_ is the annealing time to obtain the ground state
energy with precision ∆ _E_ _[∗]_ and _T_ _A_ _[′]_ [is the annealing time]
to achieve a _T_ _A_ _[−]_ [2] behaviour of the energy residue.
From the simulation data for _U/t_ _H_ = 4, _ϵ_ ( _L_ ) cannot
be determined with sufficient accuracy. However, Fig. 2
already suggests a benign scaling of the onset, which alludes to a polynomial scaling of annealing time for large
system sizes. In Appendix C, we show that similar results
and analysis for a sinusoidal annealing schedule hold.
To check the performance of quantum annealing in
the strong coupling regime we perform simulations for
_U/t_ _H_ = 8 _,_ 16. Figs. 3a and 3b show the behaviour of the
residual energies for _U/t_ _H_ = 8 and _U/t_ _H_ = 16, respectively. The insets show the corresponding estimates for
the onsets _ϵ_ ( _L_ ) from which we find that


_ϵ_ ( _L_ ) _∼_ _L_ _[−]_ [0] _[.]_ [7] _,_ (33)


providing evidence for the benign scaling of the onset
points with system size.
Figure 4 shows the scaling of _α_ ( _L_ ) for _U/t_ _H_ = 4 _,_ 8 _,_ 16.
The parallel lines are suggestive of a consistent scaling
with _L_ dependence. For _U/t_ _H_ = 16,


_α_ ( _L_ ) _∝_ _L_ [1] _[.]_ [29] _._ (34)


Combining these results to extrapolate the scaling of required _T_ _A_ to arbitrarily large _L_, we find from Eq. (32)
that,


_T_ _A_ _< T_ _A_ _[′]_ _[∝]_ _[L]_ [0] _[.]_ [995] _[ .]_ (35)


To calculate the ground state energy in practice requires performing measurements on the quantum device and sampling the outcomes. Since _H_ _H_ contains 3

nentially in number, requiring exponential computer resources. Our analysis of the scaling of required time to
find the ground state energy using quantum annealing
suggests at least a polynomial quantum speed-up over
existing alternatives. Moreover, the speed-up to find the
ground state itself is exponential. Even though the problem is _solved_ in the thermodynamic limit, demonstrating
an exponential improvement using a quantum algorithm
for obtaining the ground state reinforces our hope towards the paradigm of quantum computing for solving
quantum many-body problems.
Quantum annealing is currently being studied extensively for solving various quantum and classical problems

[14–23]. There are problems for which we see promise

[18–20], and there are problems for which quantum annealing does not seem to bring any advantage [21]. By
approaching quantum many-body problems like the Hubbard model with the algorithm of quantum annealing and
investigating its performance, we are able to add significant strength to the promise of the utility of adiabatic
quantum computing and quantum annealing.
We find two regimes of scaling depending on the required precision ∆ _E_ _[∗]_ to find the ground state energy. For
system size _L < L_ _[∗]_, where _L_ _[∗]_ is the system size for which
∆ _E_ _[∗]_ corresponds to the onset of the _T_ _A_ _[−]_ [2] behaviour of the
residual energy, the obtained time complexity is _O_ ( _L_ [0] _[.]_ [62] )
and the fits in Fig. 4 provide compelling evidence for this
scaling. For the _L > L_ _[∗]_ regime, the scaling estimates are
coarse but still suggestive of a bound on the annealing
time that is linear in _L_ . Nevertheless, ∆ _E_ _[∗]_ can be chosen to be arbitrarily small, in which case _L_ _[∗]_ becomes
very large. In practice, to obtain a highly precise estimate of the ground state, a sublinear increase of required
annealing time would suffice even for large systems.
Such a scaling behaviour of the required annealing time
can be understood to appear as a consequence of the absence of phase transitions in the one-dimensional Hubbard model at nonzero _U_ [3, 6]. This means that the
dominant gap closing in the spectrum of the annealing
Hamiltonian is at _s_ = 0 [29]. Since the gap at _s_ = 0
decreases linearly, a polynomial scaling of required annealing time is to be expected.
Resource requirements for the considered implementation on a universal quantum computer also show promise
for future fault-tolerant architectures. Since the number of gates grows linearly for one Suzuki-Trotter step,
the total number of gates for finding a near-precise
ground state scales like _O_ ( _L_ [1] _[.]_ [62] ). Furthermore, the gate
depth is constant per Suzuki-Trotter step for the onedimensional case, which means that the depth also scales
like _O_ ( _L_ [0] _[.]_ [62] ). Even though such computations with
thousands of gates might not be a near-term possibility,
the scaling of resources augurs well for the era of fault
tolerance. On the other hand, analog devices with capabilities of simulating Hubbard-like Hamiltonians [46–48]
might also turn out to be useful in the near future.
Showing evidence of a substantial scaling advantage
for an integrable quantum system also invites inquiry

into the power of quantum annealing for solving nonintegrable quantum many-body systems. However, nonintegrable quantum systems, like the two-dimensional
Hubbard model, are expected to show the presence of
phase transitions. Depending on the order of these phase
transitions, the minimum gap in the spectrum of the
annealing Hamiltonian can be either exponentially or
polynomially decreasing. Considering this, a quantum
speed-up for solving the one-dimensional Hubbard model
does not necessarily suggest a similar benefit for multidimensional many-body quantum systems.
Nonetheless, the question of a quantum advantage using quantum annealing for such systems is still open, and
the potential of it persists. Our results drive us to look
further into problems like Hubbard models in more dimensions. If not for solving them, quantum annealing
can also provide a gateway to understanding phase transitions in these models [29].

**Appendix A: Givens rotations**


We follow the method of preparing the initial state
using Givens rotations as given in references [29, 30].
It can be seen from Eq. (12) that the initial state is
decoupled in the spin degrees of freedom. This means
that we can prepare the state of the first _L_ qubits independently from the state of the last _L_ qubits. Hence, we
can suppress the spin index and write a matrix equation
like the following:



 [=] _[ Q]_

Figure 6: Circuit that prepares the ground state of
Eq. (7) for _L_ = 5, _N_ _↑_ = 3, _N_ _↓_ = 2


where _Q_ is defined by the transformation in Eq. (12).
It can be shown that the matrix _Q_ can be decomposed
into a sequence of Givens rotations that act on creation
operators of neighbouring sites [29, 30], where a Givens
rotation is defined as,



�



_G_ _i,i_ +1 ( _θ_ ) =



cos _θ_ sin _θ_

_−_ sin _θ_ cos _θ_
�



_,_



and the angles can be calculated as shown in Ref. [30].
To see how these Givens rotations that transform the
creation operators can be used to prepare the initial state,
we can check how they transform a fermion state and map
this operation into the one for a qubit state. If we have
a fermion state for a system with _L_ = 5 and _N_ = 3 as
_|_ 11100 _⟩_, then


_G_ 3 _,_ 4 ( _θ_ ) _|_ 11100 _⟩_ = _G_ 3 _,_ 4 ( _θ_ ) _c_ _[†]_ 1 _[c]_ _[†]_ 2 _[c]_ _[†]_ 3 _[|][V][ ⟩]_

= sin ( _θ_ ) _c_ _[†]_ 1 _[c]_ _[†]_ 2 _[c]_ _[†]_ 3 _[|][V][ ⟩]_ [+ cos (] _[θ]_ [)] _[c]_ _[†]_ 1 _[c]_ _[†]_ 2 _[c]_ _[†]_ 4 _[|][V][ ⟩]_
= sin ( _θ_ ) _|_ 11100 _⟩_ + cos _θ |_ 11010 _⟩_ _._


Then, a circuit that implements a Givens rotation on
two neighbouring qubits can be constructed as shown in
Fig. 5. Once the sequence of Givens rotations is known,
the full circuit that prepares the initial state can be constructed. Figure 6 shows a circuit that prepares the initial state for a system of spin- 2 [1] [fermions with] _[ L]_ [ = 5,]

_N_ _↑_ = 3 and _N_ _↓_ = 2.


**Appendix B: Solving the Bethe-ansatz equations**


In order to calculate the residual energies for the problems considered, we need to obtain the corresponding
values of the exact ground state energies _E_ 0 ( _L, N, N_ _↓_ )
by solving the Bethe-Ansatz equations. There is no
known analytical solution for these coupled algebraic
equations due to their nonlinearity. However, they are
quite tractable numerically. We use standard software
packages that solve nonlinear equations and find the roots
of Eqs. (2) and (3).

Hamiltonians with 2 _N_ _↓_ = _N_ = _L_ and _U_ = 4 _t_ _H_ .


Figure 8: The computation time _T_ _BA_ to solve the
Bethe-ansatz equations as a function of _L_ for Hubbard
Hamiltonians with 2 _N_ _↓_ = _N_ = _L_ and _U_ = 4 _t_ _H_ .


We are interested in finding the ground state energy
of the half-filled Hubbard model (2 _N_ _↓_ = _N_ = _L_ ) for
a range of system sizes _L_ . We thus calculate _E_ 0 ( _L_ ) =
_E_ 0 ( _L, N_ = _L, N_ _↓_ = _L/_ 2) using Eq. (4) and the obtained
roots _{k_ 1 _, k_ 2 _. . . k_ _L_ _}_ . Figure 7 shows the _L_ -dependence
of _E_ 0 ( _L_ ).
To get an idea of how the implemented root finding
algorithm performs to find the ground state energy, we
plot the time the computer program takes to find the
roots of the Bethe-ansatz equations for each _L_ in Fig. 8.
Clearly, the data can be fit to,


_T_ _BA_ _∝_ _L_ [3] _[.]_ [3] _,_ (B1)


indicating the polynomial growth of the required time to
find the ground state energy by solving the Bethe-ansatz
Eqs. (2) and (3).

_U/t_ _H_ = 4.



**Appendix C: Sinusoidal schedule**


We repeat the simulations for the annealing schedule
with a sinusoidal dependence on _s_ . Namely,



_H_ ( _s_ ) = _−_ _t_



_L_
� ( _c_ _[†]_ _iσ_ _[c]_ _jσ_ [+] _[ c]_ _[†]_ _jσ_ _[c]_ _iσ_ [)]

_⟨i,j⟩,σ_



In Fig. 9b, we plot the simulation data for _α_ ( _L_ ) with
_L_ = 2 to _L_ = 16. We obtain,


_α_ ( _L_ ) _∝_ _L_ [2] _[.]_ [478] _._ (C4)


By substituting in Eq. (C3), we find (for ∆ _E ≤_ _ϵ_ ( _L_ ))


∆ _E ∝_ _[L]_ [2] _[.]_ [478] _._ (C5)

_T_ _A_ [4]


For a required precision to the ground state energy
∆ _E_ _[∗]_ _≈_ _ϵ_ ( _L_ _[∗]_ ), we have,

For such a schedule with _H_ [˙] (0) = _H_ [˙] (1) = 0, the dependence of the bound in Eq. (5) changes to [34, 45, 49]


1 _−| ⟨ϕ_ 0 (1) _|ψ_ (1) _⟩|_ [2] _≤_ _[κ]_ _,_ (C2)

_T_ _A_ [4]


where _κ_ is independent of _T_ _A_, and thus, we also expect a
_T_ _A_ _[−]_ [4] behavior of ∆ _E_ for large _T_ _A_ . Figure 9a shows this
behavior where we see for a system size dependent onset
_ϵ_ ( _L_ ), when ∆ _E ≤_ _ϵ_ ( _L_ ),


∆ _E ≈_ _[α]_ [(] _[L]_ [)] _._ (C3)

For this case also, _ϵ_ ( _L_ ) could not be determined accurately. However, an indication of a polynomial scaling of
the onset is still apparent in Fig. 9a. For _L < L_ _[∗]_, we see
a sublinear scaling of _T_ _A_ with system size, with the same
exponent for two different annealing schedules.
